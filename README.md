**1. Creating a Redis Cluster using the create-cluster script**
```
wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-5.0.0.tar.gz
tar xzf redis-5.0.0.tar.gz
cd redis-5.0.0
make
cd utils/create-cluster
```
By default, this utility will create 6 nodes with 1 replica and will start creating nodes on port 30000. 
```
./create-cluster start
../../src/redis-cli -p 30001 cluster info
```
It should show the cluster_state as failed, and cluster_slots_assigned as 0
```
./create-cluster create
```
Executing "cluster info" after it shows that cluster state is "ok" and cluster_slots_assigned are 16384

**2. Setting up a multi-host redis-cluster**

Redis recommendation is to have at least one slave for each master
- Minimum 3 machines
- Minimum 3 Redis master nodes on separate machines (sharding)
- Minimum 3 Redis slaves, 1 slave per master (to allow minimal fail-over mechanism)

Eg below to install a 3 node cluster:
1. To create a new cluster from scratch, spin up at least 3 ec2 hosts
2. Copy `redis-cluster.sh` script to all hosts and run it
3. On any host run the below command to create the cluster
```
redis-cli --cluster create [host1]:7000 [host1]:7001 \
[host2]:7000 [host2]:7001 \ 
[host3]:7000 [host3]:7001 \
--cluster-replicas 1
```
Verify Redis Cluster
```
redis-cli -h [host1|host2|host3] -p 7000 cluster info
redis-cli -h [host1|host2|host3] -p 7000 cluster nodes
redis-cli --cluster check [host1|host2|host3]:7000
```
**3. Redis cluster behind HAProxy**
```
./haproxy.sh host1:7000 host1:7001 host2:7000 host2:7001 host3:7000 host3:7001
```
Access HAProxy Stats:

URL: http://<haproxy_server_ip>:1947

Login user: admin

Login password: admin

```
./redis-cli -c -h <haproxy_server_ip> -p 5000 get mykey
```

Redis sharded data automatically into the servers.
Redis has a concept hash slot in order to split data. All the data are divided into slots.
There are 16384 slots. These slots are divided by the number of servers.
If there are 3 servers; A, B and C then
Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.
Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.
Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.
In our example cluster with nodes A, B, C, if node B fails the cluster is not able to continue, 
since we no longer have a way to serve hash slots in the range 5501â€“11000.

However when the cluster is created we add a slave node to every master, 
so that the final cluster is composed of A, B, C that are masters nodes, 
and A1, B1, C1 that are slaves nodes, the system is able to continue if node B fails.

Node B1 replicates B, and B fails, the cluster will promote node B1 as the new master and will continue to operate correctly.

Every Redis Cluster node requires two TCP connections open. The normal Redis
TCP port used to serve clients, for example 6379, plus the port obtained by
adding 10000 to the data port, so 16379 in the example.

This second *high* port is used for the Cluster bus, that is a node-to-node
communication channel using a binary protocol. The Cluster bus is used by
nodes for failure detection, configuration update, failover authorization
and so forth. Clients should never try to communicate with the cluster bus
port, but always with the normal Redis command port, however make sure you
open both ports in your firewall, otherwise Redis cluster nodes will be
not able to communicate.

The command port and cluster bus port offset is fixed and is always 10000.

Note that for a Redis Cluster to work properly you need, for each node:

1. The normal client communication port (usually 6379) used to communicate with clients to be open to all the clients that need to reach the cluster, plus all the other cluster nodes (that use the client port for keys migrations).
2. The cluster bus port (the client port + 10000) must be reachable from all the other cluster nodes.

If you don't open both TCP ports, your cluster will not work as expected.

The cluster bus uses a different, binary protocol, for node to node data
exchange, which is more suited to exchange information between nodes using
little bandwidth and processing time.


The directive `cluster-enabled` is used to determine whether Redis will run in cluster mode or not. 
But by default, it is no. You need to change it to yes to enable cluster mode.

Redis Cluster requires a configuration file path to store changes that happen to the cluster. 
This file path should not be created or edited by humans. The directive that sets this 
file path is `cluster-config-file`. Redis is responsible for creating this file with 
all of the cluster information, such as all the nodes in a cluster, their state, and persistence variables. 
This file is rewritten whenever there is any change in the cluster.
The maximum amount of time for which a node can be unavailable without being considered as failing is specified by the directive `cluster-node-timeout` (this value is in milliseconds). 
If a node is not reachable for the specified amount of time by the majority of master nodes, it will be considered as failing. If that node is a master, a failover to one of its slaves will occur. 
If it is a slave, it will stop accepting queries.Sometimes, network failures happen, and when they happen, 
it is always a good idea to minimize problems. If network issues are happening and nodes cannot communicate well, 
it is possible that the majority of nodes think that a given master is down and so a failover procedure should start. 
If the network only had a hiccup, the failover procedure might have been unnecessary. 
There is a configuration directive that helps minimize these kinds of problems. 
The directive is `cluster-slave-validity-factor`, and it expects a factor. 
By default, the factor is 10. If there is a network issue and a master node cannot communicate well 
with other nodes for a certain amount of time (cluster-node-timeout multiplied by cluster-slave-validity-factor), 
no slaves will be promoted to replace that master. When the connection issues go away and the master node is able to communicate well with others again, if it becomes unreachable a failover will happen.

Redis Cluster data sharding
---

Redis Cluster does not use consistent hashing, but a different form of sharding
where every key is conceptually part of what we call an **hash slot**.

There are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute what is the hash
slot of a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo
16384.

Every node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots,
so for example you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where:

* Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.
* Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.
* Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.

This allows to add and remove nodes in the cluster easily. For example if
I want to add a new node D, I need to move some hash slot from nodes A, B, C
to D. Similarly if I want to remove node A from the cluster I can just
move the hash slots served by A to B and C. When the node A will be empty
I can remove it from the cluster completely.

Because moving hash slots from a node to another does not require to stop
operations, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash
slots hold by nodes, does not require any downtime.

Redis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all the keys involved
into a single command execution (or whole transaction, or Lua script
execution) all belong to the same hash slot. The user can force multiple keys
to be part of the same hash slot by using a concept called *hash tags*.

Hash tags are documented in the Redis Cluster specification, but the gist is
that if there is a substring between {} brackets in a key, only what is
inside the string is hashed, so for example `this{foo}key` and `another{foo}key`
are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot, and can be used together in a
command with multiple keys as arguments.
